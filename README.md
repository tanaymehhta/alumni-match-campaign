## UX/UI Specification for AI Designer

### Product Principles
- **Delight first**: Fast, celebratory, and friendly interactions. No friction.
- **One-thumb flow**: Everything reachable with a thumb on small screens.
- **Predictable gestures**: Horizontal swipes for pages, vertical scroll for content, taps for actions.
- **Motion with purpose**: Animations communicate state, direction, and progress.
- **Low cognitive load**: Minimal text per view, strong hierarchy, progressive disclosure.

### Global Interaction Model
- **Primary navigation**: Left/right swipe between pages; velocity threshold with easing and snap.
- **Secondary navigation**: Vertical scroll within a page to reveal longer content or media.
- **Direct actions**: Tap buttons and chips; long-press optional for haptics (platform permitting).
- **Exit/Back**: Left swipe returns to previous page; visual breadcrumb dots reflect position (1–5).

### Global Layout & Visual Style
- **Viewport**: Full-bleed cards pinned to safe areas; avoid notch and home indicator.
- **Typography**: Bold display for headlines, high-contrast body text, 1.4–1.6 line-height.
- **Color**: Warm, upbeat palette; success greens for positive actions; confetti multi-color.
- **Depth**: Soft shadows and subtle parallax to create layers; avoid heavy borders.
- **Buttons**: Large, rounded, shadowed; clear affordances with press states.
- **Micro-states**: Hover (desktop), active, focus-visible (keyboard), disabled.

### Page-by-Page UX
1) Page 1 – Curiosity Hook
   - **Goal**: Nudge a right swipe; set tone.
   - **Layout**: Minimal headline, subtext hint, right-pointing affordance (chevron/gradient cue).
   - **Gestures**: Left swipe disabled (show gentle bounce + hint "Swipe right →"). Right swipe advances.
   - **Animation**: Headline fades in, subtle rightward shimmer indicating direction.
   - **Empty/Error states**: N/A; offline badge (if detected) as tiny non-blocking toast.

2) Page 2 – The Match
   - **Goal**: Celebrate, introduce Tanay, invite scroll to video.
   - **Layout**: Stacked sections: Celebration → Intro card → Video reveal.
   - **Gestures**: Scroll to reveal video; horizontal swipes still active at top and after video.
   - **Animations**: "It’s a Match!" scales in, confetti bursts, heart pulse (3 cycles then idle);
     intro card slides up with slight overshoot; video fades in on 50% scroll.
   - **Media behavior**: Video auto-plays muted on reveal; tap toggles mute; inline controls; poster before load.
   - **Sound**: Optional match sound only after explicit tap (respect autoplay policies); volume remembered.
   - **Accessibility**: Reduce Motion disables confetti and large motions; offer textual celebration line.

3) Page 3 – About Tanay
   - **Goal**: Convey credibility and vision with scannable hierarchy.
   - **Layout**: Card with headline, bullets grouped by Achievements and Vision; ample spacing.
   - **Gestures**: Vertical scroll for full content; horizontal swipes for page nav.
   - **Animations**: Staggered bullet reveal on first entry; subtle parallax background.
   - **Content density**: Keep bullets to 1–2 lines; truncate with fade if needed on small devices.

4) Page 4 – Vote Decision
   - **Goal**: Convert excitement into action; make it playful.
   - **Layout**: Prompt + two large actions: "Yes" and "Hell Yes!"; swipe-up panel with instructions.
   - **Gestures**: Tap on buttons triggers confetti + haptic; right swipe advances to Share; swipe up reveals how-to-vote.
   - **States**: Button press → scale down 0.96 + shadow tighten; released → burst, label animates.
   - **Feedback**: Success toast: "Locked in!" with checkmark; persists 2s; accessible live region.

5) Page 5 – Share & Action
   - **Goal**: Promote frictionless sharing; provide QR and copy link.
   - **Layout**: Big headline, WhatsApp share button, generic share, copy link, QR code tile.
   - **Behavior**:
     - If Web Share API available: Open native sheet with title/text/url.
     - Else: Copy link to clipboard with toast; show QR for alternative.
   - **Animation**: Buttons float-in upward; QR fades in; minor idle hover on desktop.

### Gesture & Physics Details
- **Swipe thresholds**: 30% card width or velocity > predefined value; snap back otherwise.
- **Easing**: Out-cubic for exits, out-back for celebratory entrances; durations 180–320ms.
- **Edge guards**: Page 1 left swipe and Page 5 right swipe produce bounce + hint only.
- **Conflict resolution**: Vertical scroll has priority when gesture angle within ±20° of vertical; otherwise horizontal takes over with lock-on after 12px.

### Animation System
- **Library**: anime.js for page transitions and staggered reveals; CSS transitions for micro-interactions.
- **Performance**: Translate/opacity only; will-change applied briefly; 60fps target.
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; swap confetti/large motions for color and scale fades.

### Feedback & States
- **Toasts**: Non-blocking bottom toasts for copy/share success; auto-dismiss 2–3s; ARIA live polite.
- **Loading**: Skeletons for image/video; shimmer bars; compact spinners only when necessary.
- **Errors**: Media-load fail shows friendly retry chip; share unsupported shows copy-link fallback.
- **Persistence**: Remember sound preference, last visited page (session), share success (to prevent repeat prompts).

### Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Touch targets**: ≥44px; spacing to avoid accidental taps.
- **Color contrast**: WCAG AA minimum; critical text at AAA where feasible.
- **Focus management**: Logical tab order; visible focus; swipe navigation mirrored by keyboard arrows.
- **Screen readers**: Descriptive labels (e.g., "Celebrate match", "Play video muted"); headings define structure.
- **Locale**: Copy avoids idioms; numbers and actions are clear and translatable.

### Responsive Behavior
- **Phones**: Portrait-first; content scales to 360–430dp widths gracefully.
- **Tablets**: Centered column with increased paddings; optional two-column bullets on Page 3.
- **Desktop**: Card centered with background vignette; hover micro-interactions enabled.
- **Orientation change**: Preserve scroll position per page; media scales to letterbox with safe paddings.

### Visual Assets & Brand Touches
- **Photography**: Friendly, approachable; soft drop shadow; rounded corners matching cards.
- **Iconography**: Simple line icons with 2px stroke; consistent sizing grid.
- **Confetti palette**: Greens, golds, and accent brights; density modest to preserve performance.

### Instrumentation (Non-invasive)
- **Events**: page_view, swipe_next/prev, video_play/pause/mute_toggle, vote_yes/super_yes, share_invoke, share_fallback_copy, qr_view.
- **Privacy**: No PII; aggregate only; respect Do Not Track where available.

### Definition of Done for UI
- Navigation is fully one-thumb usable with clear affordances and tactile feedback.
- Animations feel crisp, purposeful, and are performant on mid-range devices.
- All actions provide immediate, accessible feedback with fallbacks.
- The experience is delightful yet minimal, guiding users seamlessly from curiosity to sharing.
